# LCOM - BitSpace

 This repository contains all the work done by me and CÃ©sar Medeiros during the UC - Computer's Laboratory (LCOM) from the Integrated Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at FEUP.

 If you're currently taking the course, good luck, LCOM is a challenging course where you can learn a lot, but you'll have to work.


### Lab Classes

 My advice is that you really understand the theory and always go to the last lab class with everything completed, good lab classes are the foundation to a good project as you'll necessarly use them. Also **don't try to copy** from other people because professor Souto will catch you.
