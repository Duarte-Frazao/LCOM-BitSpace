# LCOM - BitSpace

 This repository contains all the work done by me and [CÃ©sar Medeiros](https://github.com/Cesar-Medeiros) during the course Computer's Laboratory (LCOM) from the Integrated Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at FEUP.

 It contains the lab classes and also the final project, which was selected as one of the best and thus choosen to be presented at SPE (Week of the Engineering Profession).
 
 If you're currently taking the course, good luck, LCOM is a challenging course where you can learn a lot, but you'll have to work.


### Lab Classes

During the semester we had labs where we had to develop device drivers to later use in the project.


### Final project

 For an overview of our project, the final report is a good start, we'll leave a sneak peak here. 
 If you happen to have any doubts relating to our project feel free to contact us.
